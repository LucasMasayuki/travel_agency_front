**Description**: Travel agency front


## Introduction

The travel agency application was carried out in order to test integrations with various types of endpoints, soap and rest, consuming various types of services and assembling a complete application with the theme travel agency.

This is the project of the front end, which was developed entirely in flutter, so that it was possible to develop with a single code base, on several platforms, mainly web and apps.
